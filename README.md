# Healthcare Predictive Modeling Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data, utilizing machine learning in the healthcare domain. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.

## Project Structure

- **1. Data Collection:**
  - Loaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
  - Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame.

- **2. Data Preprocessing:**
  - Removed rows with missing values to ensure data consistency.

- **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Utilized pair plots to visualize relationships between features, considering the 'Outcome' (diabetes) variable.
  - Created a correlation heatmap to identify feature correlations.

- **4. Feature Selection/Engineering:**
  - Selected relevant features: 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age'.

- **5. Model Selection:**
  - Chose advanced models: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

- **6. Model Training:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.

- **7. Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
  - Random Forest Testing Accuracy: 0.740
  - Gradient Boosting Testing Accuracy: 0.753

- **8. Validation:**
  - Used a separate validation dataset for further model assessment.
  - Random Forest Validation Accuracy: 0.727
  - Gradient Boosting Validation Accuracy: 0.753

- **9. Interpretability:**
  - Explored feature importance for Random Forest to understand key predictors.

- **10. Additional Visualization:**
  - Included boxplots and countplots for better understanding of the data distribution.

## Validation Results

- **Model 1 (Random Forest) Validation Accuracy: 0.766**
- **Model 2 (Gradient Boosting) Validation Accuracy: 0.766**

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning in predicting diabetes based on patient data. The chosen models exhibit promising accuracy, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting providing robust predictions. The inclusion of visualizations enhances interpretability.

## Future Improvements

- Explore hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Investigate additional features or datasets for improved predictions.
- Consider ethical implications and biases in the model.
